# WAT?
Do you know what does 'WAT' mean?

There are several interest features of how ruby interpreter works.
There are same things in JS and other languages, that we use in our work.
My idea is to find more of this and make some kind of joke-report.
Presentation with telling about these features and showing funny pictures.
So it could be a great rest time in our program.
Of course only if there would be other interest presentations.
